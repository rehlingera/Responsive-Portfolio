                <p>I work in mental health and am currently filling a position in a group home organization as a Quality Compliance 
                    Specialist. We specialize in providing services to individuals with a history of mental illness, traumatic brain 
                    injury and substance abuse. As part of my role I am working on a mobile app which allows our management employees 
                    greater mobility in their jobs. So far it has had a beta release, and our testers seem to enjoy the freedom it 
                    gives them to work away from their desktop computers. I am very attracted to the design aspect of the app. I am 
                    using Microsoft PowerApps Studio to develop it, as it is secure and connects to the entire Office 365 suite, which 
                    we use for almost all our work.</p>
                <p>I enjoy traveling and trying out new experiences. I most recently traveled to Jamaica with my lovely girlfriend 
                    Alex (see photo). Reading is one of my passions; a life goal of mine is to have a huge library in my house. 
                    Alex and I live with two cats, Katya and Khoshekh. On my spare time I enjoy hanging out with friends and playing 
                    role playing games. I also watch a lot of television.</p>
